        CollegeSpace, the Socio-Academic Portal of NSUT, is the most frequently
        visited website of NSUT. It was started out by a team of three
        enthusiastic students with an aim to provide a holistic solution to all
        student needs; those that are encountered during these four crucial
        years of college. Now, after five successful years, we have a large team
        of hardworking & committed students working in various departments such
        as web development, content writing & content collection. In short - We
        aim to make the life of every NSUTian simpler & turn these four years
        into a smoother ride!
